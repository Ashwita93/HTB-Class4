# Read Easy (HTB-Assignment3)
Hacking the Browser - Assignment 3 (Playing with chrome extensions)

Read Easy 
Assignment for week 3 class. I have created this github repo to keep track of the development of this chrome extension.
Read Easy is intended to be a chrome browser extension that enables users to set up their pages to appropriate reading backgrounds while they are reading content. 

For example: if the user is reading some content late at night without any light, the dark mode will be enabled to ensure that they can read with ease.
